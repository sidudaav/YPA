                The Physics Speed Bowl (PSB) was the first ever event hosted by YPA, and it
                was a huge success! After receiving high interest for the event, we selected the first
                32 teams to register for the event. In PSB, teams from across the world faced off against
                each other to fight out the problems in a high paced quiz bowl type format.
                Congratulations to our winners
