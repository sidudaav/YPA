        <ol>
            <li class="main-rule">
                Judging will involve around 8 judges and will be broken into two parts.
                <ul>
                    <li class="sub-rule">
                        PART 1: each judge will give a score out of 10 to each of the qualities
                        listed in Tasks(2), and the 10 best programs with the highest scores on
                        average will be considered for part 2.
                    </li>
                    <li class="sub-rule">
                        PART 2: each judge will rank the top 10, and the winners will be decided by
                        best average rank from all of the judges. The ranking will be based off of
                        the qualities listed in Task(2).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="main-rule">
                While judging, the judges will not know the name of the contestant to remove any bias.
                Having your name on the program is not recommended as doing so will result in lower
                judge scores.
