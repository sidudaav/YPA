        <p class="event-details-description">
            In Think Physics!, your goal is to write a paper that aims to make progress in solving
            some type issue using physics. You can propose a hypothetical solution to any problem
            you would like. This includes global issues or a small one in our daily lives. However,
            whatever solution you propose must be rigorously backed by physics or other scientific principles.
