        <p class="welcome-banner-description">
            The Young Physicists Association (YPA) is a student-run organization that provides opportunities and
            events
            for getting more high schoolers across the world interested in physics.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 why-to-join">Why Should I Join YPA?</h2>
        <p class="why-to-join">
            That's a great question! YPA is an organization with the goal of spreading an interest in physics
            to high schools all over the world. By creating or being a member of a chapter,
            competing, or even just telling others about us, you help this mission succeed. YPA serves as a
            centralized
            physics organization for high school students, something not present in the past. We want to reach as
            many students as possible and allow them to participate in activities they enjoy, whether
            it is participating in quiz bowls with their friend, taking written competitions, or even
            just talking with others about the subject which brings us all together.

        <p class="what-events">
            YPA aims to host a large variety of events ranging from test events to paper
            sumbissions. Regardless of what contest is occuring, YPA will stay true to its goal of
            making physics contests more accessible for students who have a deep interest in physics.
            Unlinke most physics olympiads, YPA makes contests which are fun and uniqueâ€“contests which will be
            intellectually challenging to both the AP student and the IPhO Gold Medalist. You can find more
            information about our events under the Events tab.
