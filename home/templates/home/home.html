            The Young Physicists Association (YPA) is a student-run organization that provides opportunities and
            events
            for getting more high schoolers across the world interested in physics.

        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 why-to-join">Why Should I Join YPA?</h2>
        <p class="why-to-join">
            That's a great question! YPA is an organization with the goal of spreading an interest in physics
            to high schools all over the world. By creating or being a member of a chapter,
            competing, or even just telling others about us, you help this mission succeed. YPA serves as a
            centralized
            physics organization for high school students, something not present in the past. We want to reach as
            many students as possible and allow them to participate in activities they enjoy, whether
            it is participating in quiz bowls with their friend, taking written competitions, or even
            just talking with others about the subject which brings us all together.
